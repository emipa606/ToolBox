ToolBox is an XML based framework, designed for making mod settings that allow changes to ThingDef properties. Examples: cost, hitpoints, beauty, etc. It can also be used to provide a guide or information regarding your mod. It currently has 11 property widgets that can be applied to a ThingDef, and will continue to expand in the future.

Note: the settings will appear inside of the ToolBox settings. It does not act as an independent setting.

Any mod that does not have any modifiable ThingDef should be fine. And if it does, the level of incompatibility may depend on the mod placement. It is advised to use a mod&apos;s default mod setting, instead of making one using ToolBox. Issues may occur if the two mods are changing the same property of a ThingDef. It will either pick one over the other or simply not change at all.

Q1: Is this compatible with RIMMSqol?
A1: Yes, as long as you&apos;re not modifying both of the same property of a ThingDef.
